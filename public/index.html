              Hello, I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisstiteler" target="_blank">Chris Stiteler</a>
              I was a Chemistry major in college, and shortly after graduation I started learning to code for fun.
              Almost 3 years later and I'm nearing completion of my Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern.

              This portfolio page is comprised of my work for Prof. Jose Annunziato's Web Development course, CS5610, Spring Semester, 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
              Find me <a href="http://twitter.com/_stiteler" target="_blank">@_stiteler</a> or at <a href="http://github.com/stiteler">github.com/stiteler</a>.

          <div class="well well-lg page" id="project">
            <h1 class="header">Flairdrop</h1>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="http://webdevspring2016-stitelerchris.rhcloud.com/project/client" target="_blank">flairdrop</a> is a minimalistic professional
              social network. Inspired by the terse expressiveness of twitter and the professional atmosphere of linkedin. Flairdop aims to provide
              a platform for professionals optimized to find others with similar flair.  Each user can choose up to three skills that they feel
              best encompass their skillset.  I used to be a recruiter in the Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries, and Linked-in was a useful
              tool, however the sheer amount of bloat on each user's profile was overwhelming.  It was often hard to find people on the platform 
              when searching for a core set of skills, it seemed everyone had the skills I was looking for, but few mastered them.  By limiting user
              expression, flairdrop is optimized for professionals who seek to stand out in their category.  TL:DR: flairdrop aims to emulate the business card and handshake relationship created at an in person networking event. 
            </p>

              <h2>Design</h2>
            <p> 
              In lieu of the minimal and professional inspiration of the site I wanted the design to remain simple as well. The layout borrows from
              a scrapbook, in that every element of every page is built as a "card".  Each page is then built from individual cards of information.  
              This card concept makes optimizing the site for mobile a great experience, each element can flow as paper as one might reorganize photos
              in a scrapbook.  The design also utilizes dropshadow effects to make each card pop out from the page.  This is used subtle to emphasize
              certain aspects of the page that might contain more importance, or that require more immediate attention of the user. It is important
              to note, however, that though the design is Google's Material design, it's written in bootstrap with a fantastic port from
              <a href="http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/" target="_blank">fezvrasta</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Features</h2>
              <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Profile:</strong> Every user has access to a flairdrop profile page.  This is where they update their three flair selections.
                Flair should take some consideration by users as it's the primary way others can find them, including recruiters. They can also
                include some basic information, like their region, name, industry, and a beacon, which lets others know they are looking for either
                work, connections, recommendations, or nothing at all.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Search:</strong> Basic users can search for other users by flair, allowing them to find others with similiar skills,
                or others who's skillset might complement their own well.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Connect:</strong> Once a user finds another user that they like, they can connect to that person which
                enables some additional features for the relationship. Every user can see their connections in a connections
                view, which allows them to browse and remove connections.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Recommend:</strong> Once a user is connected to another user, they can recommend them for their flair.  This is indicated
                by the thumbs up on the flair when viewing another's profile page. Recommendations show up for all users who are
                visiting a user's profile.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Events:</strong> Anytime a user connects or recommends another user, or when any user updates their profile image
                or their profile media, it shows up in an event stream on the home page of the app.  (To see the event stream),
                after logging in, you can click the flairdrop logo and it will take you to the home page of the application.
                In my opinion, combined with the 3rd party media API, this is the most useful and fun feature that I developed
                such far for flairdrop.  It was an afterthought in my initial prototype, but once implemented, I thought it was
                really neat to see the changes user's were making to their profiles. </p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Media (3rd part API):</strong> My primary third-party API is <a href="//embed.ly" target="_blank">Embedly's</a>
                OEmbed API. In short, embed.ly provides embeds for hundreds of different providers.  By utilizing their OEmbed API,
                I'm able to allow users of flairdrop to embed almost any media from any popular website, be it articles, images, videos, music
                etc.  See their list of <a href="//embed.ly/providers">supported providers</a> to get a feel for what they can do. In the grand
                scheme of flairdrop as an application, the custom embedded media gives each user the MOST freedom to show the world what they're 
                all about.  Users could choose to post a personal interview, a song that they made, an article they wrote, etc. </p>
              </li>

              <li><p><strong>Other APIs:</strong> Embedly also offers a simple in-html <a href="//embed.ly/display">display api</a> for resizing and cropping images in-situ without custom styling. I'm using this to control the size of profile images to ensure a uniform experience for all users.  Also
              I'm using the gravatar API offered from wordpress, which looks up an image from the hash of a user's email.  If any user is registered
              with gravatar, supported by a number of other websites, then their gravatar image will become their default image.  If they aren't registered,
              then gravatar's api returns a nicely styled and randomized graphic.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li><p><strong>Advanced Recruiter Search:</strong> My second type of user is a role superimposed on top of a normal user.  Currently,
                recruiters have access to advanced search features.  Namely, they can search by name, region, and beacon, in addition to searching by 
                flair.  This allows them to find users who they might be interested in for a specific job in a given city or area. This is a prototype
                to developing a "premium" functionality for flairdrop. 
              </p></li>
              </ul>
              
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Handling unsupported Embed.ly providers.</li>
              <li>Messaging functionality between connected users, and between recruiters and all users.</li>
              <li>Administration improvements are required to manage users, since a Recruiter was my second user type, I feel the need
              for a site admin.  This admin would have the ability to better manage existing users (ie, upgrading them from a regular user
              to a recruiter, for example).</li>
              <li>Search improvements (If I ever went to production with this I'd make "user documents" and implement an elasticsearch cluster
              for indexing and search functionality, which would be an improvement upon default mongo/node search.</li>
              <li>New User on boarding (Right now profile creation leaves a bit to be desired).</li>
              <li>Better navigation into the search process (allow linking of flair to a search for that flair for other users).</li>
              <li>There's almost certainly some bugs I need to fix.</li>
              <li>FYI: This actual "about me" page is NOT yet optimized for a mobile experience. However, flairdrop is mobile first.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
